# "Precision" Reading

## Maintaining Subject-Verb Continuity

* Stick to the same subject when moving from one clause to the next to avoid forcing the reader to refocus attention unnecessarily.
* Exceptions: Sometimes changing subjects is necessary or beneficial for precision, variety, etc. Use judgment.

## Ensuring Precise Comparisons

* Directly juxtapose the two things being compared. Don't compare a thing to a concept.
* Avoid illogical comparisons like comparing someone to themself ("worse than anyone on his team").

## Clarifying Pronoun References

* Ensure pronouns clearly and explicitly refer to their intended antecedent.
* Avoid vague pronouns referring to entire ideas rather than nouns.
* Repair unclear pronouns by replacing with the noun, rewriting to be more explicit, etc.

## Preventing Misplaced or Dangling Modification

* Place modifiers close to the words they modify.
* With introductory phrases, put the modified noun immediately after.
* Check sentence-ending modifiers for unintended meaning.

# "Bias-Free Language" Reading

## Querying or Revising Biased Material

* Query or revise text, images, etc. that promote stereotyping, marginalization, or insensitivity.
* Balance author freedom with preventing unintentional offense.
* Have a policy for when/how much to intervene on generic "he" and other issues.

## Avoiding Gender Bias

* Replace gendered job titles (chairman, businessman, etc.) with gender-neutral alternatives from style guides.
* Query examples with stereotypical gender roles or imbalance.
* Respect transgender and nonbinary individuals' pronoun preferences.

## Using Appropriate Terminology for Groups

* Use current preferred terms for racial, ethnic, religious, and other groups.
* Query questionable/outdated language
* Avoid defaulting unmentioned groups to the "majority" (e.g. "5 men and 2 African American women").

## Flagging Legal Issues

* Watch for potential libel, privacy violations, obscenity, and copyright infringement.
* Alert editorial coordinator/author about risky passages to review with attorney.
* Note policy differences in books vs. corporate publishing regarding legal review.

# "What Copy Editors Do"

## Mechanical Editing

* Impose consistency in spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, punctuation, numbers, quotations, abbreviations, italics, bold, headings, lists, etc.
* Follow house style guides or verify the author's consistent alternate style.

## Correlating Parts

* Cross-check in-text references, footnote/endnote numbers, table/figure callouts and lists, captions vs illustrations, table of contents vs headings.

## Language Editing

* Correct or query errors in grammar, usage, diction while avoiding imposing personal stylistic preferences.
* Know when to query vs self-correct mechanical issues and when to query substantive issues.

## Content Editing

* Flag substantive issues like inconsistencies, omitted info, organizational problems, etc. for author or publisher to address.
* Check select facts to catch pervasive errors; query individual fact errors. Don't attempt to verify every statement.

## Permissions

* Remind the author to obtain permissions for long prose excerpts, poem excerpts, borrowed illustrations, etc. Ensure source lines are provided for borrowed content.

## Markup

* Identify/style special document elements like headings, extracts, tables, etc. for design and production staff.

# "Philosophical Reflections on Editing"

## Fostering Constructive Community

* Aim to improve submitted manuscripts through feedback, not just select the best pieces.
* Choose reviewers who can identify potential and suggest improvements constructively.
* View process as a collaborative community of authors, reviewers, editors working to strengthen scholarship.

## Communication Skills

* Write queries that are succinct, specific, polite, framed as requests for clarification.
* Phrase queries and decisions respectfully considering authors' needs and perspectives.
* In decision letters, balance honesty with encouragement; emphasize potential in weaker submissions.

## Editing Judgment

* Edit changes should aim to achieve the purposes of the author's work, not impose editor's preferences.
* But also consider audience needs for clarity; query if meaning seems unclear.
* Find the right balance between author voice/style and audience comprehension.

## Representativeness

* Aim for diversity of authors, approaches, geographies, etc. to reflect breadth of field.
* But ensure a rigorous yet constructive review process for all.
