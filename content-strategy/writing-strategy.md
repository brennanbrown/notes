### Mindset

> How, and to whom, will you provide value? Who is your audience, and what will your content do to improve their lives?

- Know your **why**. Think about the overarching vision you have for your life and your career and determine how this project fits into that long term vision.
  - What's your endgame? Why do you want to embark on this journey?
  - No writer has ever failed mid-keystroke.
- A blog is the basis for a media company, which has a buisness plan and revenue models.
  - Revenue can come from ad space, consulting services, a book or course, a physical product, etc.
- The first part in developing a content strategy is choosing a niche.
  - Committing to a specific topic or audience.
  - Look at what you buy recreationally, what's on your bookshelf or watch history, how you spend your free time, etc.
  - In addition, take an inventory of your current skills and expertise.
- Most content serves one of four main purposes:
  - Entertainment, Education, Persuasion, or Conversion.
