Learning Google Adsense
=======================

Advertising Basics
------------------

-   Determining the value of Ads:

-   Flat Rate: Paid monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.

-   Cost Per Action: (CPA) Paid when user completes an action on the advertiser's website.

-   Cost Per Click: (CPC) Paid when user clicks an ad.

-   Cost Per Thousand Impressions: (CPM) Paid when enough people have seen the advertisement.

-   An impression is whenever a user views an advertisement.

-   If there are three ads on a single webpage, there will subsequently be three impressions.

Discovering Ad Networks
-----------------------

-   Advertisement Networks consist of both publishers earning revenue from ads displaying on their website, and advertisers paying for the displayed advertisments.

-   Of all the advertisers in the network that meet the criteria for the advertisement position, the one that has the highest maximum bid price will win the bidding contest and their wad will be displayed.

-   In turn, the publisher earns the maximum amount possible because the highest bidding advertiser is awarded the advertisment spot.

Using AdSense
-------------

-   Google AdSense works best alongside other forms of monetization.

-   A low-maintenance advertising solution is needed.

-   AdSense ads can also be shown on websites that also sell products or services.

-   Great for blog and hobbyist websites.

Understanding Earning Power
---------------------------

-   Two primary variables that are in play when figuring out how much income you will earn are number of impressions and quality and topic of content.

-   Advertises aim to display ads on websites and blogs that are related to their target audience.

-   This means that an important factor of earning power is how much advertising budget a specific industry/company has.

-   In order to understand your own website's earning power, you simply have to use AdSense for awhile and figure out the average RPM.

-   Try to publish content related to industries with high profit margins, such as the legal or luxuries industry.

Limitations
-----------

-   AdSense should be utilized as a supplemental form of income, and not a primary source of revenue.

-   Replace AdSense ads with direct ads if advertisers come forward and request to utilize your ad space.

-   As the publisher, you have limited ability to approve ads before they're displayed on your website.

-   Advertisers pay less to advertise in a network than if paying to advertise directly.

-   Google acts as a middleman and subsequently takes a cut of the earning.

Understanding Ad Units
----------------------

-   Ad units specify the size and type of ads that will appear on the website.

-   By placing ad units on your website, you determine the location(s) where the ads will appear.

-   Google AdSense automatically places ads within the ad units on the website.

-   It's best to create reusable ad units.

-   Utilize custom channels for more specific, and subsequently higher paying ads.

-   Use URL channels to track specific pages, referring to your website's sitemap for all current pages within the website.

Maximizing Revenue
------------------

-   Consistently produce high-quality content.

-   Use recommended ad unit sizes.

-   Use the maximum number of display units (3) on every page on your website.

-   Research keywords and industries that have a high-profit margin and are willing to pay more for online advertising.

-   When looking at reports, you can add notes to specific days where there could be outlier data.
